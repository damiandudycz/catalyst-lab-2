# Catalyst Lab

**Build custom Gentoo Linux stages, live images and systems with Catalyst, from a friendly GNOME application.**

Catalyst Lab wraps [Catalyst](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Catalyst), the Gentoo
[Release Engineering](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/releng.git/) templates, QEMU and other tools in a
GTK4 / libadwaita interface. You describe what to build as a tree of stages, and Catalyst Lab prepares the build
environment, generates spec files, runs the builds and can even install the result on another machine. No deep
knowledge of Catalyst internals is needed.

> **Status:** Catalyst Lab is in active development. Features and file formats can still change. Deploying is
> currently being tested and might not work correctly.

## Features

### 📁 Projects and stages
- A project is a **tree of stages** (stage1 → stage3 → stage4, livecd, diskimage, netboot, embedded...), where each
  stage uses the build of its parent as a seed.
- Every Catalyst spec option can be edited, with values **inherited** from the parent stage or from a **Releng
  template**, or set by hand. Missing or unsupported values are marked with warnings.
- **Portage configuration** and **root overlays** are combined from Releng templates, parent stages and the stage
  itself.
- Profiles are listed from the snapshot and from the overlays used by the stage.
- Projects are **Git directories**, so their changes can be tracked and shared.
- New projects can be created from **templates** from Git repositories (like
  [catalystlab-templates](https://github.com/damiandudycz/catalystlab-templates)), with options like architecture,
  init system and additional software. See [Project templates](docs/project-templates.md) to create
  and publish one.

### 🔨 Builds
- Select the stages to build. Parent stages are **reused** from their latest builds, or built too when they have none.
- Choose the **snapshot** for each build: the project's own, any other one, or **get the latest** one, generated with
  the project toolset before building.
- Builds run **without root privileges** (unprivileged user namespaces) when the system allows it, otherwise through
  a root helper authorized with polkit.
- **Live progress**: build order, the last output line of every step, emerge progress as a percentage, colored output
  and a `build.log` saved for each stage.
- Package and kernel **caches** are kept between builds, and packages are built in parallel.
- When a stage fails, **diagnostics** are collected and the stages depending on it are skipped. Other branches of the
  tree are still built.
- The **Builds** section lists every build run of every stage, including the ones that were skipped or cancelled.

### 🧰 Environments
- **Toolsets** are isolated Gentoo environments with the tools needed for building (Catalyst, QEMU...). They are
  created from official stage3 images, kept as `.squashfs` files and can be updated from the app.
- **Virtual machines** (macOS) run toolsets where stages can't be built natively. Catalyst Lab manages them with
  [Lima](https://lima-vm.io):
  - they start when needed and stop when nothing uses them;
  - they emulate other architectures with QEMU;
  - their processors, memory and working space can be changed.

### 📚 Releng, snapshots and overlays
- **Releng** directories: clones of the Gentoo Release Engineering repository (or your fork), used as defaults for
  stages.
- **Snapshots**: compressed copies of the Gentoo ebuild repository, generated with Catalyst or imported from a file.
  You can browse the packages in each one.
- **Overlays**: additional ebuild repositories that stages can use, together with their profiles.

### 🚀 Deploy *(being tested)*
Install a built stage3 or stage4 on real hardware:
- **On another machine** booted from Gentoo LiveCD, through SSH.
- **On a disk connected to this computer** (SD card, external disk), on Linux.

The deploy wizard handles:
- **Disk**: editable partition layout with sensible defaults, GPT or MBR.
- **System**: hostname, users, root password, network, timezone, locales, keyboard layout and SSH keys.
- **Boot**: kernel (from the stage or a distribution kernel), linux-firmware and bootloader (GRUB, systemd-boot,
  rEFInd, EFI stub, or kboot for PS3 petitboot), with warnings about anything that needs manual updates later.

### 🟢 Status indicators

Items in lists and sections of the side menu have a colored dot showing their state:

| Color | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ⚪ Gray | Not used or mounted, no changes |
| 🟢 Green | Completed successfully |
| 🔵 Blue | Mounted, loaded or running |
| 🟣 Purple | Has changes |
| 🟠 Orange | Has warnings |
| 🔴 Red | Has errors |

The dot **blinks** while the item is actively used (building, running an operation), in its current color (gray
becomes blue). An item can have several states at once (eg. running and has changes): the dot shows the most
important one (red, orange, purple, blue, green, gray), and hovering it lists all of them, each with its own color.

A section in the side menu shows the most important state of its items, and blinks while any of them is used or any of
its operations runs. Results, warnings and errors (eg. completed or failed build) are shown there until the section is
opened, and again when a new one appears. Changes and ongoing states (running machines, open environments, operations) stay visible.
Hovering the dot lists items and their states.

| Item | Green | Blue | Purple | Orange | Red | Blinking |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Toolset | | Environment is open | | Catalyst is not installed | File or virtual machine is missing | Mounting, unmounting, used by operation or command |
| Virtual machine | | Running | | | Missing | Starting, stopping, used by operation |
| Project | | | Not saved changes | Last build failed | Toolset, Releng directory or snapshot is missing, Git error or conflicts | Building, updating, saving or discarding changes |
| Releng directory, overlay | | | Not saved changes | | Git error or conflicts | Updating, saving or discarding changes |
| Project in Builds (also Builds in side menu) | Last build completed | | | Last build stopped | Last build failed | Building |
| Project in Deploy | | | | | | Deploying |

## How it works

1. **Prepare an environment**: create a toolset (on macOS, create a virtual machine first).
2. **Add sources**: clone a Releng directory and generate a snapshot.
3. **Create a project**: choose its toolset, Releng directory, snapshot and architecture, then add stages.
4. **Build**: select stages and start the build. Results appear in the **Builds** section.
5. **Deploy** *(optional)*: install a stage3/stage4 build on a machine or disk.

---

## Supported systems

| | Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Building stages | ✅ On the computer, without root when user namespaces are available | ✅ In virtual machines (Lima) |
| Other architectures | ✅ QEMU user emulation | ✅ QEMU user emulation in the virtual machine |
| Deploy over SSH | ✅ | ✅ |
| Deploy to a local disk | ✅ | — Virtual machines can't access disks of the Mac |

### Requirements

**Linux**
- `bwrap` (bubblewrap) 0.11 or newer
- `squashfs-tools`, `git`
- Kernel with overlayfs and squashfs support
- For building without root: `unshare`, `newuidmap` / `newgidmap`, entries for your user in `/etc/subuid` and
  `/etc/subgid`, and unprivileged user namespaces enabled. Otherwise `pkexec` (polkit) is used.
- For deploying: `ssh`, and QEMU user emulation (binfmt) when deploying another architecture to a local disk

**macOS**
- The application bundle includes everything except `git` (install the Xcode Command Line Tools).

---

## Installation

### Linux: Flatpak

```bash
packaging/flatpak/build.sh --install
```

Builds the Flatpak from this checkout with `flatpak-builder` (GNOME runtime 51 from Flathub) and installs it for your
user. Run it with `flatpak run com.damiandudycz.CatalystLab`.
- bubblewrap, squashfs-tools and Python packages are downloaded as pinned sources and built into the Flatpak.
- Options:
  - `--bundle` creates `dist/CatalystLab.flatpak`, which can be installed on other computers;
  - `--clean` starts from scratch.

### Linux: directly on the host

```bash
./install.sh
```

This builds the app with Meson and installs it system-wide (`sudo ninja install`).

### macOS: application bundle

```bash
packaging/macos/build-app.sh
```

Creates `dist/Catalyst Lab.app` and `dist/Catalyst Lab.dmg`. The bundle contains Python, GTK, libadwaita, squashfs
tools and Lima, so it runs on Macs without Homebrew.
- Build dependencies come from Homebrew and Lima from GitHub (checksum verified).
- Homebrew packages missing on your Mac are installed only for the build and removed when it ends.
- Options:
  - `--keep-packages` keeps those Homebrew packages installed;
  - `--no-dmg` skips the disk image;
  - `--clean` starts from scratch.

---

## Development

### Running from the checkout

- **Linux:** use GNOME Builder with `packaging/flatpak/com.damiandudycz.CatalystLab.json`,
  `packaging/flatpak/build.sh` or `install.sh`.
- **macOS:**
  ```bash
  brew install gtk4 libadwaita pygobject3 meson ninja squashfs lima
  ./run-macos.sh
  ```
  It uses your real Catalyst Lab folder and settings. Build files are kept in `.build-macos`.

### Updating Flatpak dependencies

- **Python packages:** `packaging/flatpak/update-python-dependencies.sh` regenerates
  `packaging/flatpak/dependencies/python3-requests.json` with the newest versions, using `flatpak-pip-generator.py`
  from [flatpak-builder-tools](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools).
- **bubblewrap and squashfs-tools:** update the release URL and `sha256` in their files in
  `packaging/flatpak/dependencies/`.

### Project layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/objects/` | Model and logic: projects, builds, toolsets, virtual machines, snapshots, deploy, root helper |
| `src/ui/` | Views (`.py` + `.ui` templates) and app sections |
| `data/` | Icons, desktop file, metainfo, GSettings schema and list of project template repositories |
| `docs/` | Documentation, eg. [project templates](docs/project-templates.md) |
| `packaging/flatpak/` | Flatpak manifest, its modules (bubblewrap, squashfs-tools, Python packages) and build scripts |
| `packaging/macos/` | macOS application bundle |

### Window structure

```
CatalystlabApplication
╰── CatalystlabWindow
    ╰── AdwNavigationView (navigation_view)
        ╰── AdwNavigationPage
            ╰── AdwOverlaySplitView (split_view)
                ├── AdwNavigationPage
                │   ╰── AdwToolbarView
                │       ╰── CatalystlabWindowSideMenu (side_menu)
                ╰── CatalystlabWindowContent (content_view)
```

### App sections

The main views of the application are **app sections**, registered with the `@app_section` decorator. It takes:
- **Display details:** title, label and icon.
- **Order:** position in the side menu.
- **Window behavior:** whether the section is shown in the side menu, and whether the side menu is shown with it.

Every section implements:

```python
def __init__(self, content_navigation_view: Adw.NavigationView, **kwargs):
```

`content_navigation_view` is created by `CatalystlabWindowContent`. A section can also be created elsewhere with
`AppSectionDetails.create_section(content_navigation_view)`.

### Navigation

A section shown in `CatalystlabWindowContent` is embedded in a `NavigationView` → `ToolbarView` structure, so it has
its own header and navigation. The main window controls the visibility of the side menu toggle that is added there.

To show a new view, push it on the section's `content_navigation_view`. To push it on the main navigation view, send
`AppEvents.PUSH_SECTION`.

### Root helper

Operations that need root privileges are Python functions marked with `@root_function`. They are sent to a helper
process started with `pkexec`, which streams their output back and can cancel them. Root access stays unlocked while
some operation holds an authorization keeper.

## Roadmap

### Planned features
- **Bugs**: collect bugs found in builds and link them with Gentoo Bugzilla.
- **Notes**: notes for projects.
- **Templates**: reusable templates derived from Releng specs or defined by the user, able to include other templates
  (with detection of circular dependencies).
- **Projects**:
  - export `.spec` and other Catalyst files instead of building in the app;
  - edit the final `.spec` before building, and show differences from the generated one.
- **Help**: text and video help for each section, opened from relevant places in the app.
- **Virtual machines on Linux**: for systems where toolsets can't run without root (unprivileged user namespaces
  blocked, eg. by AppArmor on Ubuntu or hardened kernels), as an alternative to the root helper.
  - Needs Lima configuration for Linux hosts: `vmType: qemu` with KVM, and a shared folder type that works there,
    like virtiofs or 9p.
  - See `virtual_machines_supported` in `lima.py`.

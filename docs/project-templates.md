# Project templates

New projects can be created from a template. A template describes the stages of a project (and optionally files like
Portage configuration), and can have options, like architecture or init system, that change what is created.

Templates come from Git repositories listed in
[`data/project_templates/repositories.txt`](../data/project_templates/repositories.txt). The app always downloads this
list from the `main` branch, so templates removed from it are not offered anymore. Then it downloads only the
`template.toml` files of these repositories, to show their templates and options. When a project is created, the
repository is cloned under the project name and its content is replaced with the generated project, so the project
keeps the history of the template repository.

Templates included in the official list are in
[catalystlab-templates](https://github.com/damiandudycz/catalystlab-templates), for example
[Gentoo release](https://github.com/damiandudycz/catalystlab-templates/tree/main/gentoo-release).

Templates can't run code. Values are generated with small expressions (see [Expressions](#expressions)) that only
allow a fixed set of operations, so templates from other repositories are safe to use.

## Repository layout

A repository has one template in its root, or many templates, each in its own directory:

```
gentoo-release/                 Directory of template, its name is used only in repository.
    template.toml               Required, definition of template.
    files/                      Optional, files copied to projects (see [[files]]).
    README.md                   Optional.
raspberry-pi-5/
    template.toml
    ...
README.md                       Optional, also LICENSE, COPYING (with any extension), .gitignore, .gitattributes.
```

With one template, `template.toml`, `files/` and other files are in the root of the repository.

Repositories are checked when they are downloaded, and are rejected if their latest commit contains anything else:

- other files or directories (also directories of templates without `template.toml`),
- symbolic links, submodules or executable files,
- more than 2000 files, files larger than 10 MB, or more than 50 MB of files in total.

## template.toml

```toml
format = 1                      # Optional, version of template format.
min_app_version = "0.2.0"       # Optional, oldest version of Catalyst Lab that supports the template.
name = "Gentoo release"         # Shown in list of templates and used as default project name.
description = "Stages built like official Gentoo releases."
architecture = "arm64"          # Optional, architecture of projects for templates made for one architecture.
```

The architecture of the project is set by the template when it has `architecture`, or a variable of `architecture`
type. Otherwise the app asks for it. A fixed architecture is available in expressions as `architecture`.

### Options: `[[variables]]`

Options selected when creating a project, shown in this order. All of them are optional, a template without
variables creates always the same project.

```toml
[[variables]]
id = "init"                     # Name used in expressions.
title = "Init system"           # Shown in the app.
description = "..."             # Optional, shown under the title.
type = "choice"                 # choice (default), boolean or architecture.
default = "openrc"              # Optional, the first available option is used otherwise.
when = "architecture != 'm68k'" # Optional, the option is shown only when this is true. Otherwise its value is none.
options = [
    { value = "openrc", title = "OpenRC" },
    { value = "systemd", title = "systemd", when = "architecture in ['amd64', 'arm64']" },
    "other",                    # Short form, value is also the title.
]
```

Types:

| Type | Values |
|---|---|
| `choice` | Texts from `options`. Options can have their own `when`, to be available only for some selections. |
| `boolean` | `true` or `false`, shown as a switch. Has no `options`. |
| `multiple` | Any number of `options`, shown as a list of switches. Its value is a list of selected values, `default` is a list too. |
| `architecture` | Architecture names (`amd64`, `arm64`, `arm`, `ppc`, `ppc64`, `ppc64le`, `riscv`, `s390x`, `sparc`, `x86`...). The selected one is also the architecture of the project, so the app doesn't ask for it separately. Only one per template. |

A `when` condition can use variables defined above it. When a selected value is no longer available (because of
another selection), the default or first available option is used.

### Groups: `[[groups]]`

Configuration that can be enabled when creating a project and applied to selected stages, for example sets of
packages. Every group is shown with a switch, and lists stages it can be applied to.

```toml
groups_title = "Additional software"    # Top level, title of groups in the app.

[[groups]]
id = "kernel"
title = "Kernel and firmware"
description = "Distribution kernel with initramfs."   # Optional.
default = true                          # Optional, enabled by default.
when = "architecture in ['amd64', 'arm64']"  # Optional, the group is offered only when this is true.
stages = ["stage4", "stage4-desktop"]   # Ids of stages the group can be applied to.
default_stages = ["stage4"]             # Optional, stages selected by default (all of stages otherwise).

[groups.arguments]                      # Added to arguments of selected stages.
stage4_packages = ["sys-kernel/gentoo-kernel-bin", "sys-kernel/linux-firmware"]

[[groups.files]]                        # Copied to directories of selected stages.
source = "files/kernel"
destination = "portage"                 # Relative to the stage directory.
```

- Lists in arguments are added to lists of the stage and of other groups (without duplicates), other values replace
  them.
- A group isn't applied to a stage built from a stage that already gets it (its parent, or further ancestor): the
  stage has its packages, services and files from its seed. Such stages are shown checked and disabled.
- Arguments that the target of a stage doesn't have are skipped, so a group can set for example both
  `stage4_packages` and `livecd_packages`.
- Enabled groups are available in expressions as list `groups`, for example `'kernel' in groups`. Groups can use
  variables in `when` and expressions, `[values]` can use `groups`.

### Overlays: `[[overlays]]`

Overlays (Gentoo ebuild repositories) used by stages, for example with packages or kernels for specific hardware.

```toml
[[overlays]]
id = "ps3"                              # Used in stage arguments.
url = "https://github.com/damiandudycz/ps3-gentoo-overlay.git"
name = "ps3-gentoo-overlay"             # Optional, name of overlay in Catalyst Lab when it's added.
when = "..."                            # Optional, overlay is used only when this is true.

[[stages]]
...
[stages.arguments]
repos = [{ type = "Overlay", value = "ps3" }]
```

When the project is created, an overlay already added to Catalyst Lab from the same URL is used. Otherwise it's
cloned to Overlays. The options page lists overlays and whether they will be downloaded. Children of the stage inherit
`repos` like other arguments.

### Computed values: `[values]`

Values computed from variables, available in expressions below (and in later values), in this order. Useful when the
same value is used in many places.

```toml
[values]
spec_directory = "{{ f'{variant}/' if variant else '' }}"
stage4_services = "{{ ['sshd|default'] if init == 'openrc' else [] }}"
```

### Stages: `[[stages]]`

Stages of the project. A parent has to be defined before its children.

```toml
[[stages]]
id = "stage3"                   # Used in parent of other stages.
parent = "stage1"               # Optional, id of the stage whose build is used as seed.
name = "stage3-{{ init }}"      # Name of stage in project.
target = "stage3"               # Catalyst target: stage1, stage3, stage4, livecd_stage1, livecd_stage2...
releng_template = "{{ spec_directory }}stage3-{{ init }}-23.spec"  # Optional, see below.
when = "include_stage3"         # Optional, the stage is created only when this is true.

[stages.arguments]              # Optional values of stage arguments.
stage4_packages = ["app-admin/sudo", "net-misc/chrony"]
stage4_rcadd = "{{ stage4_services }}"
```

- `releng_template` is a path of a spec in the Releng directory selected for the project, relative to
  `releases/specs/<architecture>` (for example `releases/specs/amd64` or `releases/specs/ppc/ppc64`). The stage
  inherits values from this spec. A missing spec is reported when the project is created, but the stage is still
  created.
- `arguments` are Catalyst spec options, with `/` replaced by `_` (`stage4/packages` → `stage4_packages`). Values can
  be texts, numbers, booleans or lists of texts. Empty values (`""`, `[]` or none) are skipped. Other kinds of values
  can be given in the format of `stage.json` files of projects, for example
  `profile = { type = "StageAutomaticOption", value = "INHERIT_FROM_PARENT" }`. To find names and formats, configure
  a stage in the app and look at its `stages/<name>/stage.json`.
- Arguments that are not set get the same defaults as stages added in the app (inherited from the parent or the Releng
  spec when possible). Values set by the template are shown as **Custom value** in stage settings.
- In lists, items that are none are skipped, so expressions can leave them out.
- Values that are paths to files of the project (for example fsscript or kernel configuration added with
  `[[files]]`) should use placeholders, replaced when building: `@STAGE_DIR@` (directory of the stage),
  `@PROJECT_DIR@` (directory of the project), and like in Releng specs `@REPO_DIR@` (Releng directory). For example
  `stage4_fsscript = "@STAGE_DIR@/fsscript.sh"`. Projects are moved and cloned, so they shouldn't contain
  absolute paths.

#### Kernels

Stages with kernels (`livecd_stage2`, `stage4`...) build kernels listed in `boot_kernel`. Settings of each kernel
(`boot/kernel/<name>/...` in Catalyst specs) are given in `boot_kernels`, a table of kernel names. Settings that are not
given come from the Releng spec of the stage. For example a kernel from an overlay:

```toml
[stages.arguments]
boot_kernel = ["ps3"]

[stages.arguments.boot_kernels.ps3]
sources = "sys-kernel/gentoo-kernel-ps3"
distkernel = true
dracut_args = "--xz --no-hostonly -a dmsquash-live -o btrfs"
extraversion = "ps3"
```

Settings: `sources`, `distkernel`, `config`, `dracut_args`, `extraversion`, `packages`, `use`, `gk_kernargs`,
`gk_action`, `aliases`, `console`, `initramfs_overlay`, `softlevel`. `packages`, `use`, `aliases` and `console` are
lists, `distkernel` is a boolean (`true` writes `yes`, `false` leaves it out, as Catalyst only checks if it's set), others are
texts. Groups can add settings of kernels too
(`[groups.arguments.boot_kernels.<name>]`), they are combined with settings of the stage.
Kernel settings need Catalyst Lab 0.3.0 or newer (`min_app_version = "0.3.0"`).

### Files: `[[files]]`

Files copied to the project, for example Portage configuration or root overlays of stages.

```toml
[[files]]
source = "files/stage4"                 # File or directory in template.
destination = "stages/stage4-{{ init }}" # Path in project.
when = "init == 'openrc'"               # Optional.
```

- Paths can't lead outside of the template or the project.
- Files ending with `.template` are copied without this suffix, with `{{ expressions }}` in their contents replaced.
  Other files are copied without changes.
- Stage directories are `stages/<stage name>`. Their `portage` directory is Portage configuration of the stage, and
  `root_overlay` its root overlay (files added to the root of stage4 or LiveCD). When a template adds files there,
  the stage uses them: **Stage overlay** is added to its Portage confdir or root overlay sources (after Releng and
  parent sources). Groups are an easy way to add them only to selected stages.

## Updating projects

Projects remember the template they were created from: `project-template.json` in the project has its repository,
commit, selected options and stages created from template stages. Commits that generate the project ("Create project
from template", "Update from template") change this file. The project page shows the template, own commits of the
project (not in the template), not saved changes, and **Update template** button. It's blue when the template has
changes: when the project is opened, only listing of files of the latest template is downloaded to check it.

Changes of the project have to be saved before updating. Update starts with options of the latest version of the
template, with values selected for the project (options that aren't available anymore get defaults), so they can be
changed too. Update generates the project again from the latest version of
the template, with the same options, as a new commit on top of the last generation. Then it compares three versions:
the last generation, the project, and the new generation. Settings of stages are compared one by one (stages are
matched by ids, so renamed stages are compared too), other files as whole:

- changed only in the template: applied,
- changed only in the project: kept,
- changed in both differently: you choose to keep the project version or use the template version,
- stage removed by the template (eg. option was changed), but changed in the project (its settings, or files added
  to it): you choose to keep the whole stage, or remove it.

Own commits of the project are then replayed on top of the new generation, with these decisions, so the history of the
project has its own commits on top of the latest template. Commits keep their messages and authors. The template
repository isn't a remote of the project, projects get changes of templates only this way.

Projects cloned from Git repositories are updated the same way (**Update from repository**): the remote branch is
compared with the project since the last shared commit, and own commits are replayed on top of the remote branch, so
the history of the project stays the history of its repository with own commits on top. Projects without own commits
are moved to the latest version. As commits are replayed (rebased), commits already pushed elsewhere get new ids.

## Expressions

Texts in `template.toml` can contain expressions in `{{ }}`. A text that is a single expression gets its value (which
can be a list or boolean), otherwise values are inserted as text. `when` conditions are expressions without `{{ }}`.

Expressions can use:

- names of variables, computed values, `groups` and `project_name`,
- texts, numbers, `True`, `False`, `None` and lists,
- `and`, `or`, `not`, comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`), `in`, `not in`,
- `+` (texts, lists, numbers) and `-` (numbers),
- conditional values: `'a' if condition else 'b'`,
- f-strings: `f'{variant}/'`,
- functions `lower(text)`, `upper(text)`, `replace(text, old, new)`, `join(separator, list)`.

Everything else (calling other functions, attributes, indexing, loops, comprehensions, lambdas, imports...) is
rejected. Expressions are limited in length, complexity and size of their results.

## Testing a template

Write a list of repositories in the format of `repositories.txt` and start Catalyst Lab with
`CATALYSTLAB_TEMPLATE_REPOSITORIES` set to its `file://` (or `https://`) URL, which replaces the list from `main`.
Local repositories can be added to it with `file://` URLs, for example `file:///home/me/my-templates`. Only committed
files are used.

Then create a new project, select **From template** and your template. Errors in `template.toml` are shown in the list
of templates or on the options page. Check that every combination of options creates the stages you expect: the
options page lists them as you change options.

## Adding a template to Catalyst Lab

Templates in Git repositories are added to the list in the app with a pull request:

1. Create a public Git repository with your template, following the [repository layout](#repository-layout).
2. Fork [catalyst-lab-2](https://github.com/damiandudycz/catalyst-lab-2) and add a line to
   [`data/project_templates/repositories.txt`](../data/project_templates/repositories.txt):
   ```
   https://github.com/you/your-template.git Title of your template
   ```
   The URL is followed by an optional title, shown with templates of the repository and in errors.
   A template can also be added to an existing repository with templates, like
   [catalystlab-templates](https://github.com/damiandudycz/catalystlab-templates), with a pull request there.
3. Open a pull request that changes only this file. Describe what the template creates and which architectures and
   Releng specs it was tested with.

Catalyst Lab downloads the latest list from the `main` branch of catalyst-lab-2 when templates are shown, so a merged
template is available without updating the app, and a template removed from the list (for example when it's broken
or unsafe) is not offered anymore.
Repository URLs have to use `https://`. Templates are downloaded from the default branch of their repository, so later
changes are available without changing the list. Use `min_app_version` when a template needs features of newer
Catalyst Lab: older versions show it as unavailable, with the version it needs.
